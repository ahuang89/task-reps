<strong>Task Representation Study</strong>

<strong>Overview:</strong>

This experiment investigates how participants naturally form internal task representations based on task success (hit rate). Participants will play a simple tile-activation game and are asked to report their understanding and strategy. The study examines whether performance outcomes influence the way participants conceptualize and perform the task.

<strong>Study Design:</strong>

Task: Participants activate tiles that briefly appear on the screen by pressing a designated key.

Manipulation: Hit rate of the tiles (success vs. failure conditions).

Measurement: Self-chosen task representation
